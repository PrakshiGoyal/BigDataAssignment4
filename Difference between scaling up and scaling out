Difference between Scaling up and scaling out:

SCALE UP : 
 	> it consumes more money and time as well the reliabilty will be low.
 	> Scaling up is taking what you’ve got, and replacing it with something more powerful.
 	From a networking perspective, this could be taking a 1GbE switch, and replacing it 
 	with a 10GbE switch. Same number of switchports, but the bandwidth has been scaled 
 	up via bigger pipes. The 1GbE bottleneck has been relieved by the 10GbE replacement.
 	 
 	 
SCALE OUT : 
 	> rather than scale up this will be contrast where co ordianation is better since 
 	machines were shared with work as well machine failure will be handled.
 	> Scaling out takes the infrastructure you’ve got, and replicates it to work in parallel.
 	This has the effect of increasing infrastructure capacity roughly linearly. Data centers
 	often scale out using pods. Build a compute pod, spin up applications to use it, then scale
 	out by building another pod to add capacity. Actual application performance may not be linear, 
 	as application architectures must be written to work effectively in a scale-out environment.
